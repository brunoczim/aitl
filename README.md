ASCII Bijection To IPA. International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) characters are
hard to type because of heavy unicode usage. This project implements an
on-the-fly translation between an ASCII encoding of IPA characters (called
"AITL") and actual IPA unicode characters. Unlike X-SAMPA, which sometimes is
ambiguous, AITL intends to be a precise unicode mapping.
